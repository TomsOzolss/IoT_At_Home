Compiling: 
g++ -Ofast -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard -march=armv6zk -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -pthread -Wall -I../ -lrf24-bcm remote.cpp -o remote

If RF24 is installed somewhere else:
g++ -Ofast -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard -march=armv6zk -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -pthread -Wall -I./RF24 -lrf24-bcm remote.cpp -o remote

Configuring mailing deamon:
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get install mutt
3. Create a ~/.muttrc file and edit it. Put following inside:
	set imap_user = "iot.acc.gw@gmail.com"
	set imap_pass = "iotaccgw123"

	set smtp_url = "smtp://iot.acc.gw@smtp.gmail.com:587/"
	set smtp_pass = "iotaccgw123"
	set from = "iot.acc.gw@gmail.com"
	set realname = "Your Real Name"

	set folder = "imaps://imap.gmail.com:993"
	set spoolfile = "+INBOX"
	set postponed="+[Gmail]/Drafts"

	set header_cache=~/.mutt/cache/headers
	set message_cachedir=~/.mutt/cache/bodies
	set certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates

	set move = no
4. echo "Sending an attachment." |  mutt -s "attachment" iot.acc.gw@gmail.com -a /var/log/messages


Setting up NOPOWERSAVING for WiFi:
I had the same problems with different wifi sticks on my raspberry. I tried different power supplies, different Raspberrys and also an active USB hub. So I was lucky to see your observation, that disabling wifi 'n' mode, wmm and ht_capab could lead to better results. I disabled n-mode and wmm on my wifi router Asus RT-N66U (running openwrt/tomato), and the ping time decreases from 10-100ms to 1-3ms, and the connection was very stable. Before that, the connection went down very often (after 30-60min) and where very slow in general.
But disabling the n-mode for the complete wifi network could not be the solution, so I find another recommendation (https://github.com/xbianonpi/xbian/issues/217):
    Create the file /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf which contains the line:
    options 8192cu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=0
    Reboot
That switches off power saving of the wifi stick and USB autosuspend.
    You can check if power saving mode is switched off:
    cat /sys/module/8192cu/parameters/rtw_power_mgnt
Since 24 hours the wifi connection is stable now on two different Raspberries. The ping times are slightly larger (5-6 ms) than disabling n-mode and wmm on the wifi router, but very stable and with only small variations.
